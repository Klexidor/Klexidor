### Heyo!

My GitHub profile acts as both a portfolio and a playground for my personal programming projects.

My goals:
- Be more "Out there" with my personal projects.
- Create more transparancy my development processes.
- Doing the above in the name of fun and personal development!


## Active Personal Projects
[Junkie](https://github.com/Klexidor/Junkie) - A World of Warcraft addon that automates selling the contents of your inventory based on highly customizable filters.
[Roguelike](https://github.com/Klexidor/Python-Roguelike) - I'm a nerd for traditional Roguelike games and learning new programming languages, so i combined both in a single project; a Roguelike written in Python.
