# Heyo!

My GitHub profile acts as both a portfolio and a playground for my personal programming projects.

My goals:
- Be more "Out there" with my personal projects through releases and public feedback.
- Make my development processes more transparent for others to see.
- Doing the above in the name of fun and personal development!


## Active Projects
[Junkie](https://github.com/Klexidor/Junkie) - A World of Warcraft addon that automates selling the contents of your inventory based on highly customizable filters.  

[Python Roguelike](https://github.com/Klexidor/Python-Roguelike) - I'm a nerd for traditional Roguelike games and learning new programming languages, so i combined both in a single project; a Roguelike written in Python.
